# Career Day for Girls 2020!

## Introduction
We're excited to get to play with some robotics with all of ya'll over the next 30 minutes. However, that's not a lot of time. We will  use this repository to outline what we want to get done today and hopefully as a reference for you in the future to look back on.

## Resources 
We will be using an Arduino Nano today as our microprocessor. It is a low cost, super functional and easy to interface 'mini computer'. I like to think of it as the 'brain' of my project. The awesome thing about Arduino is that millions of people like you and me use it and there is almost infinite documentation online about how to do so.
